# To-do in rust

This project was for learning rather than serious use, I used only ncurses, and tried to make almost a TUI framework, or at leaast
starting template that would help me understand what is going under the hood of TUI framework. I included my markdown notes with the project. It's not the best implementation just
my thoughts on the matter.
